# 🛡️ CardioShield — Multimodal Cardiovascular Intelligence System

> **Predict. Detect. Prevent. — Protecting hearts with AI.**

CardioShield is an AI-powered healthcare platform that integrates **clinical biomarkers** and **ECG electrophysiological signals** into a unified cardiovascular risk intelligence system.

Built for the **Byte 2 Beat — Hack4Health Hackathon**, this project demonstrates how multimodal artificial intelligence can enable early detection and explainable risk assessment of cardiovascular disease.

## ❤️ Inspiration

Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death globally. While early detection can prevent many cardiac events, most diagnostic systems rely only on static clinical metrics.

We envisioned a smarter system that could combine:

- Patient health records  
- Lifestyle indicators  
- Real-time cardiac electrical signals  

This led to the creation of **CardioShield** — a multimodal cardiovascular AI platform.
